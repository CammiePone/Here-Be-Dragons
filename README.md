A Fabric mod that adds unique and interesting Dragons to the world, each with their own physiology, behaviour, and abilities.

While most mods that add dragons would be content with changing their breath attack, Here Be Dragons aims to change how the player approaches any given dragon, by giving them unique weaknesses, strengths, abilities, and behaviours.
